# Introduction

Vertex shaders are the only programmable shaders implemented by the CTR-SDK(PICA200). Vertex shaders are written in PICA-specific assembly language. The OpenGL ES 2.0 API loads the executable files and then runs the shaders. The OpenGL ES 2.0 API can load only executable files that have been assembled and linked. You can't load shader files written in GLSL.

Vertex shaders are run from the **main** function. A **main** object is an object file that can be assembled 
from an assembly code file that has a **main** function. A reference object is an object file that can be 
assembled from an assembly code file that does not have a **main** function.
